            <p>Hi, I am a Computer Science student at Concordia University, and previously at the University of Ottawa. I am currently working on 2 projects (yet to be published). one is a website that allows users to get help with exercises related to mobility and flexibility. The other is a browser extension allowing Concordia students to export their timetables.</p>
